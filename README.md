# WebGPU 
I'm learning how to use the new WebGPU api on the web. Currently only suppoorted in latest versions of Chrome. 

Currently it's very familiar to using it in Rust, but the tutorial (published by chrome) that I followed was far better at explaining all the steps and I actually understood what was going on.

This displays a canvas which gets cleared to blue before it draws two red triangles that make a square.
