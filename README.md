# WebGPU 
I'm learning how to use the new WebGPU api on the web. Currently only suppoorted in latest versions of Chrome. 

Currently it's very familiar to using it in Rust, but the tutorial (published by chrome) that I followed was far better at explaining all the steps and I actually understood what was going on.

I diverged from the WebGPU tutorial to make a very primative Raymarcher as described in this [Youtube tutorial for OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khblXafu7iA)
